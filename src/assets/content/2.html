  Im loving Angular. It's a great way to create a web application quickly. The style of creating front end the apps has changed
  a lot since the last time I tried and it makes a refreshing change from my normal work of backend development and deployment
  to AWS.

  However, I had a few mall issues that have taken a while to resolve - mostly because this is a weekend / evening project
  but also becasue the documentation for Angular is a little confusing in places.
<ul>
<li>
The whole routing thing is a little confusing.  I can see how to use RouterLink and RouterOutletetc, but I really want to have several
components co-ordinated from a main component and reverse updates form the child components back to the 'controller' component.  I can'takenfigure out how to do this yet.'
</li>
<li>
Getting ahead-of-time compilation working was confusing and turned out to dead simple.  The problem was the documentation and a few blog posts that made is sound a lot harder than it is.
To be fair, these are all written for using Angular without the CLI.  Using the CLI is much simpler to get AOT working.  Justadd --prod and --aot to the build command.My dist files reduced
from 2.4mb to less than 500kb. Pretty cool!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, only two issues really.  Not bad, but this is just a learning exercise for me and a place to blog a few small things that may be useful to others.
