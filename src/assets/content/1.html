  As you can see, I've updated this site to now use Angular &amp; Bootstrap.
</p>
<p>
  I attempted to use Angular a while ago - last year? - and it was ok. Then version 2 came out and it changed everthing and
  pissed me off :) I should have perservered because Angular2, and now Angular4, are very nice to use. Here's the highlights
  for me:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Typescript - there is a good reason this is one of the most popular languages on StackOverflows surveys. It make JavaScript
    sensible.</li>
  <li>@Components - Building small UI components is very cool and easy to learn. No more monolithic beast just to get a simple site
    up and running. Just generate the skeleton and start adding components.</li>
  <li>Services and DI - injecting services into your components is very cool.</li>
  <li>Angular CLI - the command line tool makes it a breeze to create the site skeleton and serve it up for development. Changes
    to source are (nearly) instantly refreshed in the browser and packaging for deployment is a no-brainer. No grunt or bower
    or other shitty tools.</li>
  <li>Testing OOB - out of the box testing is awesome - at least I think it is - I don't test much :)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found that bootstrap was a peice of cake to use with this setup.</p>

<p>To get started I watched an excellent <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-getting-started-update/table-of-contents" target="_blank">course on PluraSight</a> by Deborah Kurata.
She covers all the basics of getting a site setup and running.  There are so many options and ways to setup a site with Angular. After completing this course, I discovered the ng CLI which makes things much easier.</p>

<p>It's not perfect of course - nothing is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The lite server provided via ng serve can get confused sometimes and requires a restart. (very minor)</li>
  <li>The size of the js files is rediculous - like 2mb.  I haven't figured out how to use the tree shaker yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main goal of this site was to see how far I could go without a web server.  So far, Im pretty happy.  My Amazon bill for the last month was $10 but I had some stuff running from previous playing that I forgot to destroy.</p>

<p>I'll keep adding more features to this site using Angular.  Next up is an image &amp; video gallery.</p>
