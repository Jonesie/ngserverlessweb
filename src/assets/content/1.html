  As you can see, I've updated this site to now use Angular &amp; Bootstrap.
</p>
<p>
  I attempted to use Angular a while ago - last year? - and it was ok. Then version 2 came out and it changed everthing and
  pissed me off :) I should have perservered because Angular2, and now Angular4, are very nice to use. Here's the highlights
  for me:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Typescript - there is a good reason this is one of the most popular languages on StackOverflows surveys. It make JavaScript
    sensible.</li>
  <li>@Components - Building small UI components is very cool and easy to learn. No more monolithic beast just get a simple site
    up and running. Just generate the skeleton and start adding components.</li>
  <li>Services and DI - injecting services into your components is very cool.</li>
  <li>Angular CLI - the command line tool makes it a breeze to create the site skeleton and serve it up for development. Changes
    to source are (nearly) instantly refreshed in the browser and packaging for deployment is a no-brainer. No grunt or bower
    or other shitty tools.</li>
  <li>Testing OOB - out of the box testing is awesome - at least I think it is - I don't test :)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found that bootstrap was a peice of cake to use with this setup.</p>
<p>It's not perfect of course - nothing is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The lite server provided via ng serve can get confused sometimes and requires a restart. (very minor)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
