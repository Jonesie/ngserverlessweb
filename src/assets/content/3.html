  Nearly every application I write requires me to embed and expose a version number. This helps a lot when you are releasing
  many times, especially if the version number is used across your defect tracking and source control systems.
</p>
<p>
  Becuase I only do this once per application, every few months, I always forget exactly how to do this. Also, thje process
  and code is a little different for .Net Core applications. So, hence this document.
</p>

  In .Net FX applications it was easy to specify the FileVersion or ProuctVersion attributes in an AssemblyInfo.cs file.
  Using Visual Studio 2017 you dont get these files any more - at least not by default, I'm not sure if there is a way to
  get them back - so here is what I do.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an XML file in you solution root. Call it SharedProps.props.</li>
  <li>Add the following to the file:
    <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;Project&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;Company&gt;Acme Inc&lt;/Company&gt;
    &lt;Copyright&gt;Acme Inc Â©&lt;/Copyright&gt;
    &lt;FileVersion&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/FileVersion&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the projects you want to expose a version number,edit the csproj file. Add the following to the top, just after the root
    &lt;Project&gt; tag:
    <pre>
&lt;Import Project="..\SharedProps.props" /&gt;
</pre> Thats assuming the projects are in subdirectories of the solution root.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now you just need to update the file version in this file before building the solution. If your using git then the excellent
  <a href="https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion">GitVersion</a> tool will do this for you. There are a mirad of oher solutions to do this and it really depends on your build
  server and what you use to build your application with.
</p>
<p>
To read the FileVersion at runtime you just need the following code:
<pre>
var asm = Assembly.GetEntryAssembly();
var version = asm.GetCustomAttribute&lt;AssemblyFileVersionAttribute&gt;().Version;
</pre>
</p>
